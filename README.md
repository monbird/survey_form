FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey Form

This is the second of the Responsive Web Design Projects in Free Code Camp and the objective was to build a survey form that meets Free Code Camp's user stories.

The page could be used as a newsletter signup form by an online shop.
